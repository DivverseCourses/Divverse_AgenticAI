I can’t even begin to tell you how I feel about 2024. Not because it’s hard to articulate, but because part of my brain has chosen vibes over storage. Some memories are fried and deleted — like a phone app clearing space because too much trauma detected. It’s my brain’s way of saying, “That’s above my pay grade.”

This year has been an Emotional Olympics, and let me tell you, I wasn’t exactly taking home a medal. Depression had me in the 200-meter crawl, moving slower than Nairobi traffic during rush hour. Stagnation threw me into the high jump — only it was just me jumping to conclusions and overthinking my life choices. And happiness? Happiness was that rare event where I showed up late, looking confused, and got a consolation prize because someone felt sorry for me. It’s been a rollercoaster that didn’t know when to stop, with highs that felt like cloud nine and lows that felt like being evicted from my own soul. I wanted to quit so many times, but here I am, still aiming to thrive no matter what.

You’ve heard of shadow work? Yeah, I had a full-on meet-and-greet with my inner demons, and let me tell you, they’re not exactly soft life material. Facing yourself in your darkest corners is like running into that one moody relative who always thinks chaos is the solution to everything. It’s unsettling. But growth? Oh, growth showed up — messy, painful, and as confusing as Nairobi matatu routes. I went from being an anxious-avoidant blob to a full-blown anxious wreck, back to avoidant, and then somehow landed on a dismissive combo platter. Basically, I’ve dabbled in all the attachment styles like a bad buffet. Lakini cheki, growth doesn’t always look pretty, but it’s still growth.

Still, a win is a win. Changes happened, and I get to choose how to frame it. I opened my heart more this year — big mistake for some people. My ego keeps reminding me, “You really should’ve swallowed that key and never shat it out.” Because honestly, some folks showed me premium shege I didn’t order. I learnt, yes, but can we be real for a second? Why do we always sugarcoat lessons? Like I’m supposed to sit here and say, “It’s all part of the process,” when deep down, the words “Umbwa nyinyi!” feel way more appropriate. But hey, emotional regulation says I should take the high road, and here I am… climbing it because it’s a healthier option.

On a lighter note, my siblings and I have grown closer. Sure, they annoy me to no end sometimes, but they’re my ride-or-die crew. We’ve got each other’s backs, no question about it. Also, this year, I found out about my littu illness — adenomyosis. Basically, it’s a fancy name for “your uterus throws hands like it’s in an MMA fight every month.” At one point, I went to a healer, begging her to remove the whole thing. She looked at me like I was mad, chased me away without so much as a Panadol, and told me to “just manage.” Don’t worry though, I’ll revisit that conversation — womb or no womb.

Speaking of risks, I attended my first protests this year. I’ve faced danger before, but never in such close proximity to death itself. I wish I could say I was brave enough to take a selfie with it, but alas, no time. On the brighter side, I discovered deeper truths about who I am. Beyond being an ENTJ Libra (shoutout to my chaotic energy), I’ve come to understand what drives me, what I value, and who I want to be.

This year, I’ve done my fair share of loving and hating — it’s the duality of being human, right? But let me tell you, hating? Yho, it’s a lot of work. If you sit down and really think about it, hating someone does more damage to the hater than the hatee. So, I had to let go — not out of grace, no, but because I was just tired. Like, literally drained.

I’ve uncovered truths about my reality too: eternal vigilance is key because life is rarely what it seems. I took leaps of faith so big I might as well be a kangaroo. In my career, my personal life, you name it — I jumped. And honestly? I’m glad I did. I’m proud of myself, even if I still have moments where my luteal phase comes for me like a WWE smackdown and I barely want to participate in life.

This year isn’t over yet. There’s still a lot I want to do, but I’m pacing myself. No rush, no pressure — just me and my chaotic ambition, figuring it out one day at a time. Next year, though? I plan to be bolder, better, and braver. I also want to experiment more — yes, in the light, but also in the darkness. It’s the balance right? For now, here’s to the remaining chapters of 2024: messy, unpredictable, and uniquely mine.
